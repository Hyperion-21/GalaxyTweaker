# Galaxy Tweaker
A galaxy configuerer that allows for modification and usage of custom galaxy definition files, allowing users to tweak the galaxy.

While this mod shouldn't affect old saves in any way, be careful with loading your old saves with it active.

**THIS MOD IS IN A VERY EARLY STATE! EXPECT BUGS AND CRASHES!**

## How to use
1. Download the mod like any other SpaceWarp mod (drag the BepInEx folder into the root KSP2 directory).
2. Launch the game to generate GalaxyDefinition_Default. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT GETS OVERWRITTEN WHEN THE GAME IS LAUNCHED!

### To create a new GalaxyDefinition
1. Go into the mod folder after launching the game once, and go into the GalaxyDefinitions folder.
2. Copy the GalaxyDefinition_Default.json file in there, and rename it to whatever you want (the name becomes important later, so remember it).
3. Open the .json file, and edit it however you want.
4. In KSP2, click the "Create New Campaign" button. A window should automatically appear.
5. On the list, click on the galaxy definition you created.
6. Create a new campaign. Your new galaxy should be loaded in there.

Note this mod remembers which save file is using which galaxy definition, so the target galaxy definition only works on new save files. Old save files should automatically be assigned to the default galaxy definition stored in the game files (not the `GalaxyDefinition_Default.json` that is automatically generated)
